Front Tracking is a numerical method for the solution of partial differential equations 
whose solutions have discontinuities.

/*
*				i_set_boundary1d():
*
*	Sets the boundary for an interface defined in a rectangle.
*	The interface may be arbitrarily complicated.   It is assumed
*	that all interface points lie within or on the rectangle.
*	If the interface already contains boundary curves, these will
*	be discarded.   The routine considers the given interior
*	curves and constructs a set of boundary curves such that the
*	rectangle is divided into connected components each of exactly
*	one component number.   The component number of the exterior
*	is arbitrarily ft_assigned as one greater that that of any interior
*	region.   The new boundary curves are then added to the
*	interface.   Corresponding NODES have their boundary field set.
*
*	This routine sets the current interface to intfc.
*
*	Returns 1 if successful or zero on error.
*	The routine checks the validity of the component ft_assignments of the
*	given interface and returns 0 if these are not consistent.   A zero
*	return may also be caused by an invalid interface pointer.
