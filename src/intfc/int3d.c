*
*		3D Interface Data Structures and Surgery on Surfaces
*	
*	     We want to describe an interface in 3 dimensions.	 The
*	main  application  is to represent discontinuous fluid flow.
*	In this case the surface  must	have  distinguishable  sides
*	(positive  vs. negative) to represent the distinct values of
*	the jump discontinuity.	 It seems that	the  sides  will  be
*	globally  meaningful,  over  any connected surface making up
*	the  interface.	  This	means  that  each  surface  will  be
*	oriented,  and	its  orientation  will	be  specified by the
*	orientation of the triangles which define  it.	 It  follows
*	that the boundary of each surface is oriented.
*	
*	     The boundary is an interface of 1D objects (CURVEs) and
*	0D  objects  (NODEs).  The curves have an intrinsic orienta-
*	tion, due to their description as a doubly linked list,	 and
*	this  orientation may agree or disagree with the orientation
*	defined by the surface they bound.
*	
*	     We will frequently have to consider the local structure
*	of the interface in the neighborhood of a single curve. At a
*	single curve, the surfaces which  bound	 it,  together	with
*	their  orientations,  are  specified.	This information (in
*	contrast to the analogous problem in two dimensions) is	 not
*	sufficient to label the local fragments of the surface which
*	join the curve. Not only may a surface bound a	curve  twice
*	with  both  orientations, as in a curve which is a slit, but
*	the surface may bound a curve an arbitrary number of  times,
*	and  so	 the orientation does not identify the surface frag-
*	ments in a neighborhood of the curve. To visualize an  exam-
*	ple,  consider	the  case of two parallel cylinders touching
*	along a common line. Because each surface must be connected,
*	we  have  to  regard  these  cylinders as distinct surfaces.
*	However in three dimensions, one may insert a handle between
*	the  two  cylinders, making the surfaces connected globally,
*	and thus necessarily represented by a single surface. In two
*	dimensions, we would have two touching circles, and the han-
*	dles between the circles will reconnect the four curve frag-
*	ments  which  meet at the common point in a different topol-
*	ogy, but they will not make all four curve fragments part of
*	a single connected simple curve.
*	
*	     There is  no  assumption  that  a	SURFACE	 bound	some
*	volume, although this will often be the case.  In particular
*	there is no assumption that the sides of surfaces  are	ade-
*	quately	 labeled  by the components.  The components provide
*	an efficient, but in general incomplete description  of	 the
*	orientation (side) information for each surface.
*	
*	     It is natural to assume that the boundary of a  surface
*	consists of some number of simple closed curves. In contrast
*	to the case of curves in a 2D interface, we  would  like  to
*	allow  this number to be zero, ie a possibly empty boundary.
*	There are two problems with this picture.  First of all, the
*	interface  will	 be  composed  of  many surfaces, which meet
*	along curves which may partially coincide and  may  be	par-
*	tially disjoint.  Thus each simple closed curve in the topo-
*	logical boundary  of  a	 single	 surface  amy  be  naturally
*	represented  as	 a  collection	of  CURVEs, joined at common
*	NODEs.	Secondly we must allow degenerate boundaries, in the
*	form  of  "slits",  i.e.   as  a  single  curve, not closed,
*	"drawn" on the surface.	 As before, such an open  curve	 may
*	consist of several CURVEs, meeting at common NODEs.
*	
*	     The "slit" CURVEs do not derive an orientation from the
*	SURFACE they bound, or more precisely, thay have both orien-
*	tations, according to the neighboring  triangles,  which  on
*	each  side of the slit, give the slit distinct orientations.
*	Thus  these  CURVEs  occur  in	both  the   pos_curves	 and
*	neg_curves   lists  and	 the  SURFACE  occurs  in  both	 the
*	pos_surfaces and the neg_surfaces lists of the CURVE.
*	
*	     The reason that the slits are needed  has	to  do	with
*	intersections.	 We want to resolve any generic intersection
*	which can arise	 between  valid	 interfaces.   SURFACEs	 are
*	required  to  be  non-selfintersecting except at their boun-
*	dries, which can only intersect if they coincide,  i.e.	 are
*	common	to the two SURFACEs. Alternately stated, we want any
*	representation which is a valid interface  in  all  respects
*	except for this non-self-intersection property to be capable
*	of being resolved into a fully valid  interface.   Now	con-
*	sider a plane intersecting with a cylinder of finite height.
*	The intersection is either topologically a circle, or it  is
*	a  line	 segment, i.e. a slit.	Thus the slits arise generi-
*	cally and are needed in the resolution of intersections.
*	
*	     In summary, the boundary of a surface is  an  arbitrary
*	number	(perhaps  zero) of simple closed curves and an arbi-
*	trary number of trees of curves. A tree is a  general  graph
*	with  no cycles. Each tree joins each simple closed curve at
*	most once and the collection of trees cannot add a cycle  to
*	the rest of the boundary. Here each curve may be represented
*	by one or more CURVEs.
*	
*	     There is no restriction that the CURVEs of an INTERFACE
*	arise  as boundaries of SURFACEs. In particular there can be
*	CURVEs but no SURFACEs in an interface.
*	
*	     We require each  SURFACE  to  be  connected,  and	thus
*	define a SURFACE to be a connected component of (interface -
*	topological 1D and 0D bdries).
*	
*	     Surgery on a SURFACE or INTERFACE concerns the  joining
*	or  disconnecting  of SURFACEs along common CURVEs or NODEs.
*	Let us consider typical problems.
*	
*	     SURFACEs may intersect, or a single SURFACE may  inter-
*	sect itself.  Such a situation is excluded by the definition
*	of an INTERFACE, but it may arise anyway.  The	goal  is  to
*	describe  the  intersection and to develop a package of rou-
*	tines which will allow surgery on the  (illegal)  interface,
*	so  that it can be reconstructed as a (legal) INTERFACE.  We
*	are concerned with intersections interior  to  the  SURFACE,
*	other  than those along existing CURVEs and NODEs, shared as
*	common boundary elements.  Thus the  intersections  will  be
*	removed	 by promoting the curves defined by the intersection
*	to CURVEs of the interface, thereby altering the boundary of
*	some  SURFACEs, and possibly dividing some SURFACEs into two
*	or more pieces. Further surgery may be required on a problem
*	dependent  basis,  after  this geometrical resolution of the
*	intersections.
*	
*	
*	     The data structure which defines the intersection is  a
*	CROSS,	and  each CROSS is a curve together with information
*	about which surface triangles it crosses, on which surfaces.
*	Also  whether  and  where  the intersection curves cross and
*	attaach to boundary CURVEs is significant and will be noted.
*	
*	     The first operation is to resolve the  triangles  which
*	define	the  surface,  so  that	 the intersection curve lies
*	along triangle boundaries. This routine is similar in struc-
*	ture  to  the PS_GRID construction.  It has a role analogous
*	to insert_point_in_bond() in a 2D INTERFACE. For this reason
*	it   could  be	called	insert_curve_in_surface_triangles().
*	There seems to be no role for the inverse to  this  function
*	for  a	3D interface.  Rather, insert_curve... will be built
*	of lower level routines, such as  split_tringle_along_line()
*	and    the    inverse	 of    this   low   level   routine,
*	merge_triangles(), will be needed.
*	
*	     The remaining surgery operation and its inverse is most
*	easily	understood  from  its analog in a 2D INTERFACE. This
*	would be merge_nodes() and  the	 inverse  divide_node.	 The
*	first  would  take two distinct nodes, and combine all in or
*	out curves at these nodes into in or out curves at a  single
*	node,  and  assign  some  new  position	 to  this node.	 The
*	inverse would divide the curves at a node into two sets, and
*	ft_assign	some  of them to a new node n1 and the rest to a new
*	node n2.  For a 3D INTERFACE, the routines could  be  called
*	merge_curve() and divide_curve().
*	
*	     How is one to determine if an additional boundary curve
*	will  disconnect a surface? We think of the curves and their
*	endpoints as defining a	 graph.	  The  boundary	 curves	 and
*	nodes  of  a given surface also define a graph.	 A new curve
*	is an edge of the graph. If both ends of the curve ie  nodes
*	are  already  part  of	the graph, and if they belong to the
*	same connected component of the graph, then  the  new  curve
*	(edge)	gives  rise  to	 a  new	 cycle in the graph and thus
*	disconnects the surface. The computation is O(num bdry nodes
*	of surface) to see if both ends of the new curve are part of
*	the surface boundary, and the operation	 count	is  at	most
*	O(num  nodes)**2  * O(num curves) to determine the connected
*	components.  In fact the components can be  computed  induc-
*	tively,	 adding one curve at a time, and O(num nodes) opera-
*	tions will place the ends of a new  curve  in  the  existing
*	components.  The  components  can  be labeled by a function,
*	defined on the nodes, and if  the  curve  connects  distinct
*	components,  the  function  is	redefined  with O(num nodes)
*	operations. It does not seem  likely  that  this  number  of
*	operations  will  be a problem, but if it is, the components
*	can be stored.
*	
*	     The surface will be described geometrically as  a	col-
*	lection	 of  triangles.	  A number of topics related to tri-
*	angulation will be discussed.
*	
*	1. Triangulation of an interface  described  in	 some  other
*	fashion,  such	as  by	analytic  equations,  and the global
*	retriangulation of a surface already described in  terms  of
*	triangles.   There  is	a considerable body of literature on
*	this topic.  We favor using a frontal strategy to sweep	 out
*	an  interface,	and  to add triangles from an outer boundary
*	inward.
*	
*	2. Local improvements in a triangulation,  to  achieve	e.g.
*	better aspect ratios, or designated local refinements.	This
*	is also a previously considered topic.	It is  necessary  to
*	construct  a  library  of local, elementary interface opera-
*	tions, as well as a strategy for using a sequence of elemen-
*	tary  operations  to  improve the fittness of a surface tri-
*	angulation.
*	
*	3. Resolution of a tangled interface, and the  specification
*	of the required new triangluation.
*	
*	4. Access to the points and triangles and storage.  In order
*	to  be able to access the points exactly once during a sweep
*	through the triangles, we  assume  that	 the  triangles	 are
*	ordered,  and  that  flags (binary bits) are included in the
*	boundary  flag	of  the	 tri,  which  indicate	whether	 the
*	Tri_on_side01(tri) (for example) tri occurs earlier or later
*	in    the    ordering.	   With	   this	   knowledge	 for
*	Tri_on_side01(tri),	     Tri_on_side12(tri),	 and
*	Tri_on_side20(tri) the points of a triangle  which  are	 new
*	(not  contained	 in a previous triangle) can be given.	Thus
*	an ordered list of triangles also generates an ordered	list
*	of  surface  points.   It appears that a double linked list,
*	with storage in the interface storage space is the best	 way
*	to store the triangles.
*	
*	5. Structured vs unstructured triangulations.	Unstructured
*	triangulations	will be used for all surfaces, except possi-
*	bly for the surfaces lying on the  external  boundary.	 The
*	external  boundary  faces  are equivalent to a 2 dimensional
*	computation, and it is possible to use an almost  structured
*	grid  there, with regular mesh points except near the inter-
*	face, and special triangles near the interface,	 as  in	 the
*	trigrid construction.
