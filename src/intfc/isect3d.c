*			       i_intersections3d():
*
*	Determines all curves of intersection of SURFACES of an INTERFACE,
*	guarding against various degeneracies that can occur.   The
*	boundary SURFACES, if any, of INTERFACE are not included in
*       checking for intersections unless the variable bdry = YES.
*
*       The intersection is defined by an interface, consisting of curves
*       and nodes, that is, a topologically two dimensional interface,
*       imbedded in three-space, or more accurately, a three dimensional
*       interface with no elements of maximal dimension, or having
*       co-dimension 2.  The intersection structure is stored in an
*       INTERFACE, pointed by *cross_intfc.
*
*       Associated with each bond of a curve in this interface will be a
*       pair of triangles and surfaces which give rise to the
*       intersection, and which come from the (tangled) interface.  The
*       natural direction on the bond comes from the tangent t = n1 x
*       n2, where n1 and n2 are the normals to the oriented triangles t1
*       and t2 which intersect. The intersection will continue into
*       neighboring triangles, and in this fashion define adjacent pairs
*       of intersecting triangles (one of which will normally be either
*       t1 or t2).  This pair of neighboring intersecting triangles thus
*       defines the next and prev bond, so the bonds are naturally
*       organized into curves.  There is additional information from the
*       intersection, eg. the triangles and the surfaces to which they
*       belong, which is contained in a companion data structure C_BOND.
*       The C_BOND should thus be thought of as a bond of the
*       intersection interface, augmented with additional information
*       concerning the intersection.
*
*       The C_BOND's are arranged in doubly linked lists. Initially
*	these lists are established and ordered as created, but as a later
*       step (a sort), they are ordered to correspond to a single curve
*       of the intersection interface, and the distinct linked lists are
*       maintained in a cross_list (C_BOND **) corresponding to and
*       ordered identically to the CURVE ** curves of the intersection
*       interface.
*
*       Nodes of the intersection interface are endpoints of curves, and
*	arise when the intersecting triangles t1 or t2 have a
*	surface boundary bond rather than a triangle as the prev or next
*	intersection, that is topologically when the intersection curve
*	runs into the boundary of a surface. Thus a node arises when
*	the curve c describing the intersection of surfaces s1 and s2
*	runs into either the boundary of s1 or of s2. Eventually, the
*	NODES of the intersection interface may require a data structure
*	of their own, to contain the supplementary intersection
*       information.
*
*	The connectivity of the CROSS_ELEMENT structures into curves
*	is contained in the CROSS structure.  It contains a doubly
*	linked list of CROSS_ELEMENTS that correspond to individual
*	bonds on the curve defined by the intersecting surfaces.
*	CROSS is a global object describing the entire intersection
*	of a pair of surfaces,  while CROSS_ELEMENT describes a single
*	pair of crossing surface elements.
*
*	Usage:
*	       status = i_intersections3d(intfc,cross_list,bdry);
*	       INTERFACE *intfc;
*	       C_BOND   ***cross_list;
*	       int bdry;
*
*	returns one of  the following:
*	
*	    1. NO if topology construction fails
*	    2. clean_up() if add_to_pointers() fails
*	    3. YES otherwise

*       The test for intersections of triangles is based on linear
*       algebra to solve systems of three equations and betweenness
*       properties.  Given TRIs ti, i = 1,2, with vertices ai, bi, ci,
*       in cyclic order, none of which coincide, we form the directed
*       normal uni_arrays ni, e.g.  ni = (ci - ai) x (bi - ai).  Each
*       triangle either has all its vertices on one side of the plane
*       defined by the other or it has two on one side and one on the
*       other (It's also possible to have one point in the
*       plane and the other two points on opposite sides of it).  In the
*       former case for either triangle, there is no intersection. The
*       test is by comparing dot products. We set B = <bj - ai . ni >
*       and C = <cj - ai . ni >.  Then if sgn B != sgn C, the edge (bj
*       -> cj) of tj cuts the plane defined by ti.
*
*       Furthermore setting lambda = C / (C - B), the point p = lambda
*       bj + (1 - lambda) cj is the point on the bj -> cj edge of tj
*       which cuts the plane of ti.

*       intersection of t1 and t2.  For each of the cut points pk, we
*       determine alpha_k = <pk - ai, l>, which parameterize the
*       projections of the cut points onto the line of intersection of
*       the planes through t1 and t2, ie the line with direction
*       parallel to l.  The occurence or nonoccurence of an intersection
*       then depends on the betweenness properties of the alpha_k. The
*       alpha_k also specify the exact location of the intersection in

*			     sort_cross_curves():

*	This routine sorts the crosses into a data structure corresponding
*	to an interface.  The interface is defined by the intersections,
*	and thus it consists of one dimensional objects (curves, bonds,
*	nodes, etc) in three dimensions.  In other words it has co-dimension
*	at least two.
*
*	The sorting is done in three passes. The first tabulates all pairs of
*	intersection triangles in lists, having common surfaces s1 and s2.
*	The second pass takes the intersecting tri pairs for a fixed
*	surface pair s1 and s2, and arranges them in bond order. If
*	necessary, the bond orientation chosen locally when the intersection
*	was identified has to be identified at this point. The bond order
*	identifies maximal chains, which are the curves of the intersection
*	interface. The third pass identifies the nodes at the curve ends,
*	and identifies how the intersection curves are joined at nodes.
