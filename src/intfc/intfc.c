*
*			INTERFACE handling Package:
*
*
*		1. 		Summary:
*
*		This file and the associated files int.h, comp.c
*	define a package of routines for defining, allocating and

*
*

*		make_interface()	Allocate an INTERFACE structure.
*		copy_interface()	Make a copy of an INTERFACE.
*		exists_interface()	Verify an INTERFACE.
*		delete_interface()	Delete and free storage for INTERFACE.

*
*
*	In addition, a set of routines is available that allows the user to
*	impose a regular rectangular grid on some rectangle containing or
*	contained in the region where the interface is defined.    These
*	routines allow efficient determination of the topological components
*	which are within any grid block.   They assume that only positive
*	COMPONENT values are used, and use the negative value ONFRONT to
*	indicate grid_blocks intersected by the INTERFACE.
*
*
*		set_topological_grid()	Establishes a regular rectangular grid.
*		is_component()		Checks if a COMPONENT meets grid-block.
*
*	A related set of routines provide information about the BONDS and
*	CURVES in a grid-block.
*
*	Documentation for all of the COMPONENT, BOND and CURVE list functions
*	is at the top of file comp.c.
*
*		2. Basic Interface Data Structures:
*
*		An INTERFACE is regarded as a topological object
*	consisting of a set of NODES joined by non-intersecting
*	CURVES.   These concepts are embodied in the definitions
*	of the mutually-recursive data structures INTERFACE,
*	NODE and CURVE given in file int.h.
*
*		A NODE is basically a POINT, describing its location
*	along with sets of CURVES which begin and end at that node
*	- we call these the  in_curves and  out_curves  of the
*	NODE.
*
*		A CURVE joins a pair of NODES without intersecting
*	another CURVE.  Thus an INTERFACE defines a decomposition 
*	of the plane into disjoint connected regions, which we call 
*	components.  Each component may be referenced by ft_assigning 
*	it an integer value or COMPONENT.   Thus a CURVE is something 
*	that connects a pair of NODES and has unique COMPONENTS on 
*	either side of it (because of the non_intersecting requirement).
*
*
*		A POINT is the basic geometrical object - an x,y
*	coordinate pair describing a position in the plane.
*
*
*
*		The code separates as much as possible the treatment 
*	of these high-level objects, from the treatment of low_level
*	features such as the specific representation of the curve
*	a CURVE represents.   Thus it should not be difficult to
*	modify the code to handle say a CURVE of parabolic sections.
*
*
*		The current code represents the curve as piecewise-
*	linear.   Thus a curve is represented as a linked list of
*	linear BONDS.   
*
*		A BOND connects two POINTS, its start and end, by
*	a line segment, and in addition has pointers to both the
*	preceding and following bonds.
*
*
*		A certain amount of redundancy is built into these
*	definitions to allow flexibility, but not at the expense of
*	significant inneficiency.
*
*		The interface package supports a form of inheritance.
*	Each data structure is associated with a size in the I_INTERFACE
*	data structure.  The allocated storage for each field is determined
*	by this size,  which is required to be a least as large as the
*	corresponding size of the structure being allocated.  This enables
*	the user to define extensions of each interface data structure to
*	include additional information specific to the problem being
*	modeled.  For example, such a construction would be of the sort
*
*	struct _MY_CURVE { CURVE Curve; MY_DATA_STRUCTURE My_struct;};
*
*	since C arranges that the alignment of the first element of a
*	structure and the structure itself are the same,  one can cast
*	a object of type struct _MY_CURVE as a curve.  This is a partial
*	implementation of the data hiding provided by C++.
*
*
*			3. Subroutines and Usage:
*
*
*		The normal sequence to create an INTERFACE calls
*	make_interface(), then creates NODES as required using
*	make_node() and lastly creates the CURVES using make_curve().
*	In fact, since CURVES connect pairs of NODES, it is essential
*	to use this strategy.   
*
*
*		POINTS are created using  Point(), and are then added 
*	to CURVES using  insert_point_in_bond().
*
*		The routine  read_interface()  provides an automated way 
*	of initializing an INTERFACE - it prompts interactively.   The
*	routine  fprint_interface()  provides formatted printing of
*	an INTERFACE in a readable format.   Then read_print_interface()
*	can be used to read the output of fprint_interface().
*
*
*		To modify an existing INTERFACE, use the routines
*	make_node(), delete_node(), make_curve(), delete_curve(),
*	insert_point_in_bond(), delete_start_of_bond().   When
*	working on an INTERFACE, the routine  next_point()  is
*	a convenient way to step through the POINTS of the INTERFACE
*	one by one.   next_point() may be used simultaneously on
*	any number of INTERFACES.
*
*		
*		The copy_... routines all work on the current interface,
*	with the exception of copy_interface() which defines a new
*	current interface.   If it is desired to modify two or more
*	INTERFACES simultaneously, this should be done by making
*	calls to  set_current_interface()  before working on a new
*	INTERFACE.	The value of the current interface can always
*	be found using  current_interface().   Note in particular that
*	if the current interface is deleted, then the current INTERFACE
*	is set to NULL.
*
*
*		The routines  split_curve()  and  join_curves()  can
*	be used to perform surgery on an INTERFACE.   split_curve()
*	splits a CURVE at an internal POINT into two CURVES with a 
*	common NODE.   join_curves()  joins a pair of CURVES which
*	have a common NODE to form a single CURVE.   Both routines
*	allow the COMPONENT specifications on the sides of the
*	new CURVE(S) to be specified, facilitating changes in
*	topology.
*
*
*		All of the routines do considerable error checking.
*	In addition each routine accomplishes as much related work
*	as possible.   Thus for example  make_curve()  not only
*	allocates a  CURVE  structure, but also inserts the CURVE
*	into the current INTERFACE CURVE list, into the in_curves
*	and out_curves of each of its end-NODES and initializes
*	the first and last BONDS on the CURVE with the end-NODES.
*	Generally, each routine can be assumed to do all of the
*	obvious book-keeping automatically, but when in doubt
*	the documentation above each routine should be consulted.
*
*
*
*		Again in order to make the package more flexible,
*	each routine finishes by executing some user provided code.
*	The I_INTERFACE data structure provides a family of function
*	pointers that can be defined by the user to take additional
*	action for the given function.  Such pointers may be NULL,
*	in which case no action is taken.  An example of the usage
*	is illustrated below.
*
*	struct _MY_POINT { POINT pt; double distance;};
*	then we set size_point in the I_INTERFACE structure to
*	sizeof(struct _MY_POINT);
*
*	EXPORT void my_user_Point(POINT *p)
*	{
*		((struct _MY_POINT *) p)->distance =
*				hypot(Coords(p)[0],Coords(p)[1]);
*	}
*			
*
*
*
*		4.  Storage Allocation Scheme:
*
*	The routines that create and modify INTERFACES all use a 
*	common storage_allocator.   There are no restrictions 
*	anywhere in the code on the number or sizes of INTERFACES, 
*	NODES, CURVES, BONDS or POINTS.   If the storage allocator
*	runs out of space at some point, the routine that called
*	it will return an error value, generally 0 or a NULL
*	pointer as appropriate.   The low-level storage allocator
*	is not called directly.   The INTERFACE code maintains a
*	higher level storage allocator which dispenses space as
*	required and only occasionaly calls the low level one.
*	The low level allocator is called  scalar()  while
*	the higher level allocator is called  store().
*
*	The code maintains the concept of a current INTERFACE.
*	All operations that create or modify INTERFACES are
*	always applied only to the current interface.   The
*	high-level storage scheme associates a chain of large
*	blocks of space with each interface.   When the blocks
*	for the current interface are exhausted and more space
*	is needed, the low_level allocator is called to allocate
*	a new large block (Chunk) of size ChunkSize(intfc).   The Chunks
*	for a given interface are stored as a linked list.
*	This procedure tends to keep each interface stored very 
*	contiguosly and prevents unnecessary fragmentation in the 
*	low_level storage allocator.
*
*	In addition, for internal purposes the code maintains a
*	list of interfaces TABLES.   Each table summarizes the
*	storage statistics of an INTERFACE, and in fact contains
*	the INTERFACE structure.   This list of TABLES is itself
*	maintained as a linked list, and as new INTERFACES are
*	created space for their TABLES is first allocated from
*	the low-level allocator.   The code is structured in
*	such a way that none of the user-visible routines ever
*	explicitly reference these TABLES.
*
*
*	Finally the code uses a peculiar data structure called
*	a set to represent dynamically growing and shrinking
*	sets of NODES and CURVES.   These sets of pointers are
*	manipulated using the routines  add_to_pointers()  and  
*	delete_from_pointers(), which in turn use a lower-level
*	allocator called expand_set().

/*
*				Interface Table:
*
*	Records Storage and other information for INTERFACES in use.
*	Records the information as a linked list of Tables, one for
*	each Interface.
*	Storage for the linked list is generated dynamically as
*	needed.   This allows programs to manipulate varying
*	numbers of interfaces without difficulty.
*
*	Within each Table, a further linked list of
*	ChunkSize(intfc)-sized blocks of storage is maintained -
*	this is the actual area where bonds, curves etc are stored for that
*	interface.   Individual Chunks should be large enough so that
*	large parts of an interface are stored contiguosly.   The use of

*	without incurring major loss of contiguousness.   The lowest level
*	storage allocator is only called occasionaly - whenever a new Chunk 
*	is required. Thus there is little overhead incurred by the low level
*	storage scheme.   The actual dispensing of pieces of a chunk is done
*	by the routine  store().

/*
*			next_point():
*
*	Called via the macro next_point().
*
*	Returns through its last three arguments the next point on a 
*	specified interface.   "Next Point" is defined as follows:
*
*	Before a TRUE call to next_point() on a given INTERFACE, it
*	should first be initialized to the start of the INTERFACE
*	by a call with NULL arguments:
*
*			(void) next_point(intfc,NULL,NULL,NULL);
*
*	At the first call to next_point(intfc,..) following such
*	initialization the point returned is the first point on the 
*	first hypersurface of intfc.   
*
*	Otherwise, if the last point returned was not at the
*	end of a hypersurface, then the next point on that hypersurface
*	is returned. Otherwise the first point on the next hypersurface
*	is returned. In this way all points of all HYPER SURFACES are
*	traversed.   Note that lower dimensional structures such as
*	NODES and CURVES in 3d will in general be encountered several times.
*
*	The pointers *P, *HSE, *HS are set to point to pointers to the
*	point, its hypersurface element and hypersurface.
*
*	In two space dimensions HS is a curve on which P lies and
*	HSE is the bond on that	curve STARTING at the point.
*	For an endpoint of a curve, *HSE will be NULL - thus the point is
*	at the end of the bond *C->last if a bond is required.
*
*	In three space dimensions *HS is a surface containing P,  and *HSE
*	is a triangle on that surface with P as a vertex.
*	
*	next_point()  may be freely intermixed with calls to
*	next_bond()  and  next_curve().
*
*	next_point  returns either 1 when the next point is a valid point,
*	or 0 if there is no remaining point, or if an error occurs.
