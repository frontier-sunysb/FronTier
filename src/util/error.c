/*
*			General Error Handling Facility:
*
*	The routine  Error(number,message)  adds an error to
*	the current error list.   Here  number  is an (not
*	necessarily unique) integer characterizing the error.
*
*	The error messages may be retrieved later by calling
*	print_errors(), which prints them, or report_errors()
*	which returns the number and sets a pointer to the error 
*	list.   In addition, error messages are printed at the
*	time of call in FILE file, if the routine
*			set_error_immediate(file)
*	has been called.   A call with file==NULL turns off such
*	printing, which is also the default.
*
*	Generally it is expected that calls to Error() and
*	print_errors() will suffice.
*
*	Errors are maintained as a linked list of _Error 
*       data structures - see cdecs.h for the definition.
*
*	Error messages are only saved as string pointers.   Thus
*	they should not be automatic variables or allocated variables
*	and if (static) variables they should not be reft_assigned too.
